# Java-Training-Program

This repository contains various Data Structures (DS) programs implemented in Java as part of my training and learning process. It includes fundamental concepts and hands-on practice with structures like:

Arrays

Linked Lists

Stacks

Queues

Trees

Graphs

Searching & Sorting Algorithms

The goal of this project is to strengthen my understanding of core data structures and algorithm design using Java.
